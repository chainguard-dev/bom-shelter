SBOM storage for prototyping and demoing

**Initial Goals**

- Collect SPDX documents found "in the wild."
- Assess how easy or difficult it is to use different methods for finding SPDX SBOMs.
- Begin to develop intuitive sense of completeness, correctness and detail of "in the wild" SPDX SBOMs
- If enough SPDX SBOMs are found of sufficient diversity, plan requirements for and potentially build a prototype of a tool for multi-SBOM analysis.
- Prototype a cycloneDX multi-SBOM parsing demo

**Potential Long Term Goals**

- Collect CycloneDX documents too.
- If "in the wild" SBOMs are inadequate, consider building a "synthetic" SBOM dataset using a wide range of tools
