You need SBOMs? `bom-shelter` has SBOMs.

`bom-shelter` is a collection of SBOM documents that can be used for prototying SBOM tools or understanding properties of SBOMs.

The `in-the-wild` folder contains both SPDX and CycloneDX SBOMs found "in the wild," that is, associated with open source software projects. To the best of our ability, these SBOMs are meant to represent real SBOMs, not ones simply created for example purposes. Additionally, this `in-the-wild` dataset represents a diverse sample.

**Potential Long Term Goal**

- Consider building a "synthetic" SBOM dataset using a wide range of tools applied to a wide range of artifacts.
