# In-The-Lab SBOMs

The `in-the-lab` folder is for SBOMs created "in the lab," that is, generated via an SBOM-generating tool for the purpose of creating a large SBOM dataset. The `spdx-popular-containers` sub-folder contains over 3,000 SBOMs created with four different tools (`syft`, `trivy`, `bom`, and `tern`) from a list of 1,000 popular containers.
