**Notes on In-the-Wild Dataset**

At least for SPDX, attempting to find SBOMs via Google search is a waste of time.

Using the search capabilities of [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) was much more productive. Use search terms such as spdx.json or sbom.spdx to find projects that are creating SBOMs as part of their release process.

Also note that the [SPDX adoption GitHub page](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-adoption) maintained by the SPDX group has relatively few examples and does NOT appear to be particularly useful in identifying projects or companies that are creating and sharing SPDX SBOMs.
