**Notes on In-the-Wild Dataset**

At least for SPDX, attempting to find SBOMs via Google search is a waste of time.

Using the search capabilities of [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) was much more productive. Use search terms such as spdx.json or sbom.spdx to find projects that are creating SBOMs as part of their release process.

Microsoft's .NET project appears to be about to begin releasing SBOMs associated with .NET in the near future. See the [.NET SBOM guidance](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/SBOMGenerationGuidance.md). Sometime in mid-March 2022 this will likely begin to be a useful source of SPDX SBOMs that are generated though Microsoft SBOM tool.

Also note that the [SPDX adoption GitHub page](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-adoption) maintained by the SPDX group has relatively few examples and does NOT appear to be particularly useful in identifying projects or companies that are creating and sharing SPDX SBOMs.
